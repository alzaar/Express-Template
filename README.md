# Express-Template

## Instructions
Currently, this template is missing a .babelrc file. Upon downloading the files, add a .babelrc file and add the following in to the file:

```javascript
{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

To use the dotenv package, add the following at the top of the server.js file:
```javascript
import dotenv from 'dotenv'
dotenv.config()
```

Other middleware is also missing which will be added on a later time.
